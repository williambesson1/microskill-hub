                    Your brain is wired to save energy by relying on an automatic, fast "autopilot" system that is easily duped by emotion, peer pressure, and context. To make bulletproof decisions, you have to hit pause, spot the hidden mental glitch, and tag in your deliberate, analytical "thinker".

The time and money are already gone and unrecoverable; rational decisions must be based entirely on future costs and benefits." },

You must separate the dazzling presentation from the actual hard skills required." },

The first four executives immediately nod and praise it, even though you spot a massive operational flaw.", choices: [{ text: "Politely but firmly voice your concern, playing devil's advocate to break the illusion of unanimous agreement.", isCorrect: true }, { text: "Bite your tongue and nod along because you don't want to look like a naysayer.", isCorrect: false }, { text: "Agree in the meeting but complain about the terrible idea to colleagues via Slack right after.", isCorrect: false }], feedback: "Groupthink and Social Proof override common sense when groups agree too quickly. Speaking up shatters the 'illusion of unanimity'." },

Waiting prevents you from making things worse through sheer panic." },

The dealer casually asks if you want leather seats for 'just $3,000'.", choices: [{ text: "Say yes because, compared to $25,000, an extra $3,000 feels like pocket change.", isCorrect: false }, { text: "Evaluate the $3,000 strictly on its own merits—would you normally drop $3k on a leather sofa?", isCorrect: true }, { text: "Agree to every minor upgrade since you are already spending so much.", isCorrect: false }], feedback: "The Contrast Effect makes a $3,000 upgrade feel tiny next to a $25,000 car.
